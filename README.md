Crawl is an iOS application with a mission to get and display the 100th character, every 10th character and the count of words from the [Jenga API documentation website](https://developer.jengaapi.io/docs).

Open **Crawl.xcworkspace** because I've used [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/).

Thoughts on implementation:
  - Rather than perform 3 separate, simultaneous requests to the same url (to receive the same content), perform 1 request.
  - The 100th character is the 10th element in the sequence of every tenth character in the html response string.
